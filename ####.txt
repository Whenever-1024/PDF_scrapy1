My github is https://github.com/Whenever-1024/
okay, I shall say correctly. 
you know that I am vitalii, but I am not vitalii. 
I am danil, his fellow. 
I did the task by vitali's request.
It doesn't matter who did it. 
The important thing is to do it quickly and accurately.
The reason I'm honestly saying it's Danil and not Vitali is because I think you're going to get it wrong.
Let's organize everything, eliminate misunderstandings, and aim for task execution quickly.
It would be nice to know that the person who greets you with 'good morning' or 'Good afternoon', or 'Good evening' is the developer, Danil.
Because it was not possible to reach a quick conversation between the project client and the developer, the project performance was also postponed.
