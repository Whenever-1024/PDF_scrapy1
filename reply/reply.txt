We have already reviewed your samples, however we have some comments to make.

1. We must be careful with the page breaks so as not to leave us information, for example here we are missing part of the text of the "acuerdos" field

3. We must also extract this information and assign it to the dictionary.

5. For this fifth example, the "juzgado" field was not updated as per the header. Here I also take the opportunity to ask you to help us by removing the spaces so that something like this remains: "PRIMERA SALA" "SEGUNDA SALA" etc.

6. Lastly, in this sixth example, it is what was mentioned in points 1 and 2, since the page breaks are making us lose information.


Hi Vitalii, how are you?

1.

Finally, it is worth mentioning that all the information must be extracted from all the "SALAS" that exist in the PDF, not only those that are marked as an example in the TECH SPEC, that is, all these items:
